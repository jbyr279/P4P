# P4P - The Perception of Biological Motion (2022)
Part IV Project - Joseph Byrne, Alan Chen

## Data Capture

All point light walker data was captured at the University of Auckland's motion capture lab on level 8 (Department of Mechanical Engineering). The following configuration was used for node placement on the point light walker (28 nodes):

(Note: future researchers may opt for different configurations based on their requirements)

A treadmill was then placed near the centre of the motion capture space. The subject walked at moderate speed (1.5 m/s) at level 4 setting for 60 seconds and his gait was captured by the Vicon Nexus system installed in the lab. Please ask, Emanuele Romano (or other technician) for induction into the motion capture lab and additional assistance with the motion capture technology used for this project.
